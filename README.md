My first GitHub repo!
Hello Odin!

This repository contains all of my work and projects including practice files for both the foundations and fullstack courses. The submodule TOP_Foundations is the one that contains all of the practice files and projects that I will be working on as I learn the basics of programming i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many other skills and knowledge required as prerequisit for the FullStack Course.
